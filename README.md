# AdventOfCode2023

I've decided to learn Go. And what is the best way to learn if not practice? Backed by theory, of course.

The starting code is quite ugly and I'm not utilising existing tools yet, but I hope to get progressively better by the end of the calendar.

If you know how to do things better, I would be happy to hear you out and learn (:
